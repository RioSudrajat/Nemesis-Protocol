## 1. Executive Summary

**NOC ID (Nusantara Otomotif Chain ID)** is a decentralized digital passport and vehicle performance tracking system built on the **Solana blockchain**. It creates an immutable, transparent, and verifiable lifecycle record for every vehicle — from the manufacturer's assembly line to the end consumer's garage.

The platform solves systemic fraud in the used-vehicle market (odometer tampering, hidden accident history, counterfeit parts) by anchoring every service event, diagnostic scan, and part replacement to an on-chain identity. A **Unified 3D Digital Twin** acts as the primary interface, letting any stakeholder visually inspect the real-time health of every component. An **Explainable AI (XAI) engine** forecasts part failures and provides actionable insights, while a **context-aware LLM Copilot** adapts recommendations based on the user role and the specific part being inspected.

The system is designed for **enterprise-grade scalability**, leveraging Solana's sub-second finality and Compressed NFTs (cNFTs) to keep per-vehicle minting costs below $0.01, making it viable for mass adoption by OEMs across Southeast Asia.

### 1.1. Frontend MVP Status

> **As of v2.1.0, the complete frontend MVP has been implemented and is fully operational.** The application consists of **54 pages** (59 routes — see Appendix D) across **5 portal ecosystems**, powered by **3 Zustand stores** with **5 React Context shims** for hook access, and **30+ components** (11 UI + 6 3D + 2 layout + portal-specific domain components). All portals share a unified Solana-inspired dark theme with role-specific accent colors.
>
> The Admin/Superadmin portal — not part of the original 4-layer design — has been added as a 5th application layer to provide platform-wide governance, wallet-based RBAC, dispute escalation, and system configuration capabilities.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1. Industry Pain Points

| Pain Point | Impact | Current Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| **Odometer fraud** | ~40% of used cars in Southeast Asia have tampered mileage, costing consumers billions annually. | Paper-based service books that are trivially forged. |
| **Hidden accident & flood history** | Buyers discover structural damage post-purchase, facing costly repairs. | Reliance on manual inspections that miss internal damage. |
| **Counterfeit parts** | Fake brake pads, filters, and fluids compromise safety and void warranties. | Trust-based system with no cryptographic proof of part origin. |
| **Opaque maintenance records** | No single source of truth; records are fragmented across workshops. | Isolated dealership databases with no interoperability. |
| **Manufacturer warranty disputes** | Costly legal proceedings due to lack of verifiable maintenance proof. | Manual reconciliation of paper/digital records. |
| **Lack of predictive maintenance** | Reactive repair culture leads to higher total cost of ownership. | Generic OEM schedules that ignore real-world usage patterns. |

### 2.2. Why Blockchain?

A centralized database could store records, but it cannot guarantee **immutability** (records can be altered by the operator), **censorship resistance** (a single entity can deny access), or **trustless verification** (third parties must trust the database operator). Solana provides all three, with the throughput (65,000+ TPS) and cost structure ($0.00025/tx) necessary for high-frequency automotive data.

### 5.2. Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Solana over Ethereum/Polygon** | Sub-second finality, sub-cent transaction costs, native support for Compressed NFTs via Bubblegum. Critical for high-frequency maintenance logging. |
| **cNFTs over standard NFTs** | Genesis minting cost drops from ~$2 to ~$0.005 per vehicle. Essential for OEM mass adoption (millions of vehicles). |
| **PDAs for Maintenance Logs** | Program Derived Addresses provide deterministic, vehicle-specific on-chain storage without requiring new keypairs. Enables efficient lookups. |
| **Off-chain ML, on-chain anchoring** | ML inference is too compute-intensive for on-chain execution. Predictions are computed off-chain and their hashes are anchored on-chain for auditability. |
| **React Three Fiber (R3F)** | Production-grade 3D rendering in React. Enables component-level interaction, animation, and integration with the existing React component tree. |
| **RAG-based LLM over fine-tuned model** | RAG allows the Copilot to leverage real-time on-chain data without expensive retraining. Context injection per-click ensures relevance. |
| **Zustand for client state (Active)** | 3 Zustand stores (`useAdminStore`, `useBookingStore`, `useEnterpriseStore`) serve as the primary client-state layer. Each store persists to localStorage independently. Chosen for minimal boilerplate, devtools support, and easy migration to server-side state when the backend is integrated. |
| **React Context as shim layer** | 5 Context providers wrap the Zustand stores (`AdminContext`, `BookingContext`, `EnterpriseContext`) for backward-compatible hook access (`useAdmin()`, `useBooking()`, `useEnterprise()`). `ActiveVehicleContext` and `PartCatalogContext` remain standalone with `StorageEvent` cross-tab sync. |
| **Framer Motion for animations** | Production-grade animation library for React. Used for page transitions, micro-interactions, and UI state animations across all 5 portals. Replaced React Spring in the initial tech stack. |

```

> **Frontend Implementation:** The Copilot UI is built as two shared components — `CopilotChatPanel` (inline chat) and `GlobalCopilotSidebar` (slide-out panel). Both are available in DApp and Workshop portals. Currently uses simulated responses; RAG pipeline is target architecture.

#### 7.5.2. Context Injection Protocol

When a user clicks a 3D part, the following context payload is assembled and injected as the system prompt for the LLM:

```json
{
  "context_type": "part_inspection",
  "user_role": "owner | mechanic | manufacturer",
  "vehicle": {
    "vin": "MHKA1BA1JFK000001",
    "make": "Toyota",
    "model": "Avanza",
    "year": 2025,
    "current_mileage_km": 34521
  },
  "selected_part": {
    "component_id": "Transmission.CVT_Belt",
    "display_name": "CVT Belt",
    "health_score": 42,
    "health_status": "Critical",
    "last_service_date": "2025-08-15",
    "mileage_at_last_service": 28000,
    "service_count": 1
  },
  "chain_history": [ "..." ],
  "ai_prediction": {
    "failure_probability": 0.67,
    "estimated_days_until_failure": 45,
    "top_shap_factors": [ "..." ]
  },
  "instruction": "Respond as the NOC ID Copilot. Adapt depth and terminology to the user_role."
}
```

#### 7.5.3. Role-Adaptive Response Examples

**For Owner (Rina):**
> "⚠️ Your CVT Belt is showing signs of wear. Based on your driving patterns, our AI estimates it may need replacement within 45 days. The biggest factor is the 6,521 km driven since your last CVT service. I'd recommend scheduling a CVT inspection soon."

**For Mechanic (Pak Hendra):**
> "🔧 **CVT Belt — Critical (Health: 42/100)**\n\n**Diagnostic Summary:** Single CVT fluid replacement at 28,000 km. Current mileage: 34,521 km (6,521 km interval). XAI model flags `mileage_since_last_cvt_service` as primary risk driver (SHAP +0.38).\n\n**Recommended Procedure:**\n1. Inspect CVT belt for glazing, cracking, or width reduction.\n2. If belt width < 21.0 mm, replace with OEM part #K0800-4A00C."

        │ COMPLETED │  → Creates CompletedBooking entry
        └───────────┘    → txSig stored; accessible at /dapp/timeline/[txSig]
```

**Two entry points:**
1. **Booking flow:** User discovers workshop on `/dapp/book` → selects workshop → fills booking form → workshop accepts/rejects
2. **Walk-in flow:** Workshop scans NFC/QR at `/workshop/scan` → `createWalkinSession()` → starts at ACCEPTED status

**Data persistence:** All state persists to localStorage (`noc-booking-state`, `noc-completed-bookings`) with cross-tab synchronization via `StorageEvent`.

### 8.6. Cross-Portal Notification System (Implemented)

Notifications flow through `BookingContext.addNotification()` and are consumed by each portal's notification page filtered by `targetRole`.

**Notification Types:**

| Type | Trigger | Target Role(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `booking_pending` | User submits booking / Walk-in arrives | workshop |
| `booking_accepted` | Workshop accepts booking | user |
| `booking_rejected` | Workshop rejects booking | user |
| `booking_service` | Workshop starts service | user |
| `booking_invoice` | Workshop sends invoice | user |
| `booking_paid` | User completes payment | workshop |
| `booking_completed` | User submits review | user, workshop |
| `warranty_update` | Enterprise approves/rejects warranty claim | user, workshop |
| `recall_notice` | Enterprise issues recall campaign | user, workshop |
| `kyc_change` | Admin approves/rejects workshop KYC | workshop, enterprise |
| `dispute_filed` | User or workshop files dispute | admin, enterprise |
| `dispute_resolved` | Admin resolves dispute | user, workshop, enterprise |

### 9.4. Frontend State Model (Implemented TypeScript Interfaces)

The frontend MVP manages state through 5 React Context providers. Below are the key TypeScript interfaces that define the data model:

#### BookingContext (`frontend/src/context/BookingContext.tsx`)

```typescript
type BookingStatus = "PENDING" | "ACCEPTED" | "REJECTED" | "IN_SERVICE" | "INVOICE_SENT" | "PAID" | "COMPLETED";
type SessionType = "booking" | "walkin";

interface Workshop {
  id: string; name: string; location: string; city: string; address: string;
  rating: number; totalReviews: number; totalServices: number;
  verified: boolean; oem: boolean; specialization: string; phone: string;
  operatingHours: { weekday: string; weekend: string };
  coordinates: { lat: number; lng: number };
  badges: string[]; serviceBreakdown: Record<string, number>;
  reviews: WorkshopReview[];
}

interface InvoicePart {
  name: string; partNumber: string; manufacturer: string;
  price: number; isOEM: boolean;
}

interface InvoiceData {
  parts: InvoicePart[]; serviceCost: number; gasFee: number;
  totalIDR: number; serviceType: string; mechanicNotes: string;
}

interface BookingRequest {
  id: string; type: SessionType; workshop: Workshop;
  form: BookingForm; status: BookingStatus; createdAt: string;

}

interface CompletedBooking {
  id: string; bookingId: string; workshopName: string; workshopId: string;
  vehicleName: string; vehicleKey: VehicleKey; vin: string;
  serviceType: string; date: string; parts: InvoicePart[];
  serviceCost: number; gasFee: number; totalIDR: number;
  mechanicNotes: string; review: ReviewData | null;
  completedAt: string; txSig: string;
}

interface BookingNotification {
  id: string;
  type: "booking_pending" | "booking_accepted" | "booking_rejected" | "booking_service"
       | "booking_invoice" | "booking_paid" | "booking_completed"
       | "warranty_update" | "recall_notice" | "kyc_change"
       | "dispute_filed" | "dispute_resolved";
  title: string; message: string; time: string; read: boolean;
  targetRole: "user" | "workshop" | "enterprise" | "admin";
}
```

#### AdminContext (`frontend/src/context/AdminContext.tsx`)

```typescript
type PlatformRole = "superadmin" | "admin" | "enterprise" | "workshop" | "user";

interface WalletEntry {
  wallet: string; role: PlatformRole; entityName: string;
  status: "active" | "suspended" | "pending";
  registeredAt: string; lastActive: string;
}

interface PlatformConfig { /* See Section 6.5 */ }

interface AuditLogEntry {
  id: string; timestamp: string; adminWallet: string;
  action: string; targetEntity: string; details: string;
}

interface DisputeEntry {
  id: string; type: "payment" | "service_quality" | "part_authenticity" | "warranty";
  userWallet: string; workshopId: string; workshopName: string;
  bookingId: string; amountIDR: number;
  status: "open" | "investigating" | "resolved" | "escalated";
  createdAt: string; resolvedAt: string | null;
  resolution: string | null; assignedAdmin: string | null;
}
```

#### EnterpriseContext (`frontend/src/context/EnterpriseContext.tsx`)

```typescript
interface WorkshopMetrics {
  workshopId: string; workshopName: string;
  servicesThisMonth: number; revenueThisMonth: number;
  totalServices: number; totalRevenue: number;
  avgRating: number; ratingCount: number;
  oemPartsUsed: number; aftermarketPartsUsed: number;
}

interface FleetVehicle {
  key: VehicleKey; name: string; vin: string; health: number;
  owner: string; mileage: string; licensePlate: string; region: string;
}

interface EnterpriseMetrics {
  totalVehicles: number; avgFleetHealth: number; vehicles: FleetVehicle[];
  activeServiceSessions: number; totalCompletedServices: number; completedThisMonth: number;
  totalRevenue: number; revenueThisMonth: number; avgCostPerService: number;
  totalOemParts: number; totalAftermarketParts: number; oemRate: number;
  avgRating: number; totalReviews: number;
  workshopMetrics: WorkshopMetrics[];
  serviceTypeDistribution: Record<string, number>;
  partFrequency: { name: string; count: number }[];
  completedBookings: CompletedBooking[]; workshops: Workshop[];
}
```

#### ActiveVehicleContext (`frontend/src/context/ActiveVehicleContext.tsx`)

```typescript
const vehicleData = {
  avanza: { name: "Toyota Avanza 2025", vin: "MHKA1BA1JFK000001", health: 87, ... },
  bmw_m4: { name: "BMW M4 G82 2025", vin: "WBA43AZ0X0CH00001", health: 95, ... },
  beat:   { name: "Honda Beat 2024", vin: "MH1JFZ110K000042", health: 92, ... },
  harley: { name: "Harley-Davidson Sportster S", vin: "HD1ME23145K998212", health: 98, ... },
};
type VehicleKey = "avanza" | "bmw_m4" | "beat" | "harley";
```

#### PartCatalogContext (`frontend/src/context/PartCatalogContext.tsx`)

```typescript
interface CatalogPart {
  id: string; name: string; partNumber: string; manufacturer: string;
  compatibleModels: string[]; priceIDR: number; isOEM: boolean;
  mintedAt: string; txSig: string;
  status: "active" | "recalled" | "discontinued";
}
```

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements

### 10.1. Performance

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| 3D Twin initial load | < 3 seconds (3G connection) | Lighthouse / WebPageTest |
| 3D interaction latency | < 16ms (60 FPS) | Chrome DevTools Performance tab |
| API response time (P95) | < 200ms | Datadog / Grafana |
| On-chain transaction confirmation | < 1 second | Solana Explorer |
| ML prediction latency (P95) | < 500ms | Custom metrics |
| Copilot response time (first token) | < 1 second | Streaming SSE measurement |

> **Note:** API latency and ML prediction metrics are not yet measurable as the backend has not been implemented. The frontend MVP targets these performance goals for the client-side rendering layer.

### 10.2. Scalability

| Dimension | Target | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| Concurrent users | 10,000+ | Horizontal scaling, CDN, WebSocket clustering |
| Vehicles registered | 1,000,000+ | cNFT compression, database sharding |
| Maintenance events/day | 50,000+ | Event-driven architecture, queue-based processing |
| 3D model library | 500+ vehicle models | Asset CDN with progressive loading |

### 10.3. Availability & Reliability

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Uptime (API services) | 99.9% |
| RPO (Recovery Point Objective) | 1 hour |
| RTO (Recovery Time Objective) | 4 hours |
| Data durability (on-chain) | 100% (Solana consensus) |
| Data durability (off-chain) | 99.999% (Arweave permanence) |

### 10.4. Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all non-3D interfaces.
- 3D Twin must provide a 2D fallback for screen readers (component list with health scores).
- All text content available in Bahasa Indonesia and English.

---

## 11. Security & Compliance

### 11.1. Security Architecture

| Layer | Measure |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Solana wallet signature (primary), OAuth 2.0 + JWT (enterprise), WebAuthn (MFA). |
| **Authorization** | Role-based access control (RBAC). Roles: `Superadmin > Admin > Enterprise > Workshop > User`. Frontend MVP implements wallet-based RBAC via `AdminContext` with whitelist management. |
| **Data in Transit** | TLS 1.3 (all APIs). WSS for WebSocket. |
| **Data at Rest** | AES-256 encryption for PII in PostgreSQL. |
| **NFC Security** | NTAG 424 SUN authentication (AES-128). Unique per-tap codes. Anti-cloning. |
| **QR Security** | HMAC-SHA256 signed JWTs with configurable TTL (default 5 min) and single-use nonce. |
| **Smart Contract** | Formal audit by a reputable firm (e.g., OtterSec, Neodyme) before mainnet deployment. |
| **API Security** | Rate limiting, input validation, CORS policies, CSP headers. |
| **Dependency Management** | Automated vulnerability scanning (Snyk / Dependabot). |
| **Admin Audit Trail** | Every admin action logged with wallet, timestamp, action type, target entity, and details. Persisted in `AdminContext.auditLogs`. |

> ⚠️ **MVP Limitation:** The current RBAC implementation is client-side only. Wallet whitelisting is stored in localStorage. **Server-side authorization MUST be implemented before any production deployment.**

### 11.2. Privacy & Compliance

| Regulation | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Indonesia PP 71/2019** (Personal Data Protection) | PII never stored on-chain. On-chain data is pseudonymous (wallet addresses only). |
| **GDPR (for future EU expansion)** | Right to erasure supported for off-chain data. On-chain data is non-PII by design. |
| **OJK Regulations** (if token is classified) | Legal opinion required. $NOC designed as utility token. No investment promises. |

### 11.3. Audit Trail

Every state-changing action is logged with:
- Timestamp (UTC)
- Actor (wallet address or user ID)
- Action type
- Before/after state hash
- Solana transaction signature (if on-chain)

---

## 12. Tokenomics ($NOC)

### 12.1. Distribution

| Allocation | % | Amount | Vesting |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ecosystem Rewards** (Proof of Maintenance) | 40% | 400,000,000 | Emitted over 5 years via smart contract |
| **Development & Team** | 20% | 200,000,000 | 12-month cliff, 36-month linear vesting |
| **Treasury / DAO** | 15% | 150,000,000 | Governance-controlled |
| **Strategic Partners / OEMs** | 10% | 100,000,000 | 6-month cliff, 24-month linear vesting |
| **Community & Airdrops** | 10% | 100,000,000 | Milestone-based releases |
| **Liquidity Provision** | 5% | 50,000,000 | Locked in protocol-owned liquidity |

### 12.2. Token Flow

```mermaid

        F -->|"Vote on"| H["Workshop Disputes"]
    end
    B --> D
```

### 12.3. Anti-Abuse Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description |
|---|---|
| **Reputation-Weighted Rewards** | New workshops earn lower $NOC per service until building reputation. |
| **Duplicate Detection** | On-chain deduplication prevents logging the same service twice. |
| **Anomaly Flagging** | ML model detects suspicious patterns (e.g., 50 oil changes in a day). |
| **Slashing** | Verified fraudulent entries result in $NOC stake slashing and credential revocation. |

---

## 13. Business Model & Revenue Schema

### 13.1. Revenue Stream Overview

NOC ID operates a **multi-sided platform** connecting vehicle owners, workshops, OEM manufacturers, and insurance providers. Revenue is generated through 8 complementary streams:

| # | Revenue Stream | Type | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Platform Transaction Fee | Per-transaction | Percentage of every service payment processed through the platform | ✅ Configurable via `PlatformConfig` |
| R2 | Enterprise SaaS Subscription | Recurring | Monthly subscription for OEM/manufacturer dashboard access | 📋 Planned |
| R3 | Workshop KYC & Certification | One-time + Annual | Verification and onboarding fees for workshops | 📋 Planned |
| R4 | NFT Minting Fee | Per-vehicle | Fee charged to enterprises for minting vehicle cNFTs | 📋 Planned |
| R5 | Premium AI/Analytics | $NOC-gated | Advanced predictive insights and analytics access | ✅ Feature flag in config |
| R6 | API Access Fees | Usage-based | Third-party data access for insurance, finance, used-car platforms | 📋 Planned |
| R7 | Data Marketplace | Subscription | Anonymized fleet maintenance data sold to analytics providers | 📋 Planned |
| R8 | $NOC Token Economics | Ecosystem | Burns, staking, and treasury revenue from token velocity | 📋 Planned |

### 13.2. Platform Transaction Fee Model

The primary revenue driver. Configurable via the Admin System Configuration page (`/admin/config`).

**Fee Parameters (from `PlatformConfig`):**

| Parameter | Default Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `platformFeePercent` | 2.5% | Percentage of each service transaction taken as platform revenue |
| `gasSubsidyPercent` | 0% | Percentage of Solana gas fees subsidized by the platform |
| `minServiceFee` | Rp 50,000 | Minimum service transaction amount allowed on-platform |
| `maxServiceFee` | Rp 50,000,000 | Maximum service transaction amount allowed on-platform |

**Example Fee Calculation:**

```
Service Invoice:           Rp 500,000
Platform Fee (2.5%):     - Rp  12,500  → Platform Treasury
Gas Fee (Solana):        - Rp   4,000  → Network
Workshop Receives:         Rp 483,500

Annual Projection (500 workshops, 50 services/month each):
= 500 × 50 × 12 × Rp 12,500
= Rp 3,750,000,000 (~$234,000 USD) platform revenue/year
```

### 13.3. Enterprise SaaS Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Monthly Price | Vehicles | Workshops | Features |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Starter** | Rp 5,000,000 (~$312) | ≤ 500 | ≤ 10 | Mint console, fleet map, basic analytics, warranty management |
| **Growth** | Rp 15,000,000 (~$937) | ≤ 5,000 | ≤ 50 | + Advanced analytics, recall management, API access, priority support |
| **Enterprise** | Custom pricing | Unlimited | Unlimited | + Custom integrations, SLA, dedicated account manager, white-label option |

**Revenue Projection:**
```
Year 1: 3 Starter + 1 Growth = Rp 30M/month = Rp 360M/year (~$22,500)
Year 2: 5 Starter + 3 Growth + 1 Enterprise = Rp 95M+/month = Rp 1.14B+/year (~$71,250)
```

### 13.4. Workshop Certification Economics

| Fee | Amount | Frequency | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| KYC Verification | Rp 500,000 (~$31) | One-time | Document review, identity verification, on-chain credential issuance |
| Annual Re-certification | Rp 250,000 (~$16) | Annual | Compliance review, credential renewal |
| OEM Certification Badge | Rp 1,000,000 (~$62) | Per-OEM | Verified specialist status for specific manufacturers |
| Premium Listing | Rp 200,000 (~$12) | Monthly | Boosted visibility in workshop discovery (`/dapp/book`) |

**Revenue Projection (500 workshops):**
```
Year 1: 500 × Rp 500,000 (KYC) + 100 × Rp 1,000,000 (OEM) = Rp 350M (~$21,875)
Year 2: 500 × Rp 250,000 (renewal) + 300 × Rp 200,000/mo (premium) = Rp 845M/year (~$52,800)
```

### 13.5. NFT Minting Fee Schedule

| Volume Tier | Price per Vehicle | Solana Cost | Platform Margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–100 | $0.50 | ~$0.005 | ~$0.495 |
| 101–1,000 | $0.30 | ~$0.005 | ~$0.295 |
| 1,001–10,000 | $0.15 | ~$0.005 | ~$0.145 |
| 10,001+ | Custom | ~$0.005 | Negotiated |

**Revenue Projection:**
```
Year 1: 10,000 vehicles × $0.30 avg = $3,000
Year 2: 50,000 vehicles × $0.20 avg = $10,000
(Volume play — small margin, large scale)
```

### 13.6. Premium Feature Monetization

Features gated by $NOC token or premium subscription:

| Feature | Access Model | $NOC Cost | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI Predictive Insights | $NOC burn | 10 $NOC/query | Component-level failure predictions with SHAP explanations |
| 3D Digital Twin (Full) | Free tier limited | 50 $NOC/month | Unlimited 3D model access with X-ray, explode view, animation |
| LLM Copilot (Advanced) | $NOC burn | 5 $NOC/conversation | Extended context, OEM manual references, repair cost estimates |
| Data Export (PDF/CSV) | $NOC burn | 20 $NOC/export | Full vehicle history export for resale or insurance |

Feature flags (`PlatformConfig.features`) control which premium features are active platform-wide.

### 13.7. Data Marketplace

Anonymized, aggregated fleet data sold to third-party consumers:

| Data Product | Target Buyer | Pricing Model | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Maintenance Pattern Data | Insurance companies | Rp 50M/year subscription | Part failure frequencies by model, age, and region |
| Workshop Quality Benchmarks | OEM quality teams | Per-query API (Rp 10,000/query) | Workshop rating distributions, service completion rates |
| Regional Vehicle Health | Government/regulators | Custom contract | Road safety metrics, emission compliance indicators |
| Part Demand Forecasts | Aftermarket suppliers | Rp 100M/year subscription | Predicted part replacement volumes by region |

### 13.8. $NOC Token Revenue Loop

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  $NOC Revenue Cycle                    │

│        ↓                                               │
│   Workshop Grants ──▶ Network Growth ──▶ More Fees    │
│                                                        │
│   DAO Governance ──▶ Parameter Voting ──▶ Fee Tuning  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Token utility creates a deflationary loop:** As more services are processed, more $NOC is burned for premium features, reducing circulating supply while demand grows from workshop onboarding grants and staking rewards.

### 13.9. Market Sizing (Indonesia Focus)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Registered vehicles in Indonesia | ~165,000,000 | BPS 2025 |
| Annual vehicle sales | ~1,100,000 (cars) + ~6,500,000 (motorcycles) | Gaikindo/AISI 2025 |
| Registered workshops | ~150,000+ | Kemenperin estimate |
| Average annual maintenance spend per vehicle | Rp 2,500,000 (~$156) | Industry survey |
| Total addressable market (TAM) | Rp 412.5T (~$25.8B) | 165M × Rp 2.5M |
| Serviceable addressable market (SAM) | Rp 12.5T (~$781M) | Top-tier workshops in Java + Bali (3% of TAM) |
| Serviceable obtainable market (SOM, Year 2) | Rp 125B (~$7.8M) | 50,000 vehicles, 500 workshops (1% of SAM) |

**Combined Revenue Projection (Year 2):**

| Stream | Annual Revenue |
|---|---|
| Platform transaction fees | Rp 3,750,000,000 |
| Enterprise SaaS | Rp 1,140,000,000 |
| Workshop certification | Rp 845,000,000 |
| NFT minting | Rp 160,000,000 |
| Premium features ($NOC) | Rp 500,000,000 |
| Data marketplace | Rp 300,000,000 |
| **Total** | **Rp 6,695,000,000 (~$418,000)** |

> Note: Projections are conservative estimates for Year 2 with 500 active workshops and 50,000 vehicle passports. Revenue scales non-linearly with network effects — each new workshop and vehicle increases platform value for all participants.

## 16. Risks & Mitigations

| # | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Solana network congestion or outages | Medium | High | Implement retry logic with exponential backoff. Cache recent data off-chain. Design for graceful degradation. |
| R2 | Low workshop adoption | High | Critical | Subsidize NFC cards. Offer onboarding grants in $NOC. Provide free hardware (NFC readers). |
| R3 | Regulatory classification of $NOC as a security | Medium | Critical | Engage legal counsel early. Design token with clear utility. Avoid investment language. |
| R4 | 3D model performance on low-end devices | Medium | Medium | Progressive LOD (Level of Detail). WebGL capability detection. 2D fallback mode. |
| R5 | Smart contract vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | Multiple independent audits. Bug bounty program. Timelock on upgrades. |
| R6 | Data quality from manual mechanic input | High | High | Structured forms with validation. Photo evidence requirements. Anomaly detection ML. Community dispute resolution (DAO). |
| R7 | LLM hallucination in Copilot | Medium | Medium | RAG grounding with citation enforcement. Confidence score display. "Verify on-chain" links for every claim. |
| R8 | NFC card cloning/tampering | Low | High | NTAG 424 DNA anti-cloning. Per-tap unique authentication. Server-side validation of tap counters. |
| R9 | Competitor with centralized solution | Medium | Medium | Emphasize trustless verification as differentiator. Open-source core protocol for ecosystem lock-in. |
| R10 | ML model bias or poor predictions | Medium | Medium | Diverse training data. Regular fairness audits. Clear confidence intervals in predictions. |
| R11 | **All state stored in localStorage** | High | Medium | Data is lost on browser clear. Mitigation: Backend API integration in Phase 3. Export functionality as interim solution. |
| R12 | **No backend API (frontend-only MVP)** | High | High | All 49 pages use simulated/mock data. Mitigation: Context provider pattern isolates data access — swap localStorage for API calls with minimal frontend changes. |
| R13 | **Admin RBAC is client-side only** | High | Critical | Wallet whitelisting stored in localStorage with no server-side enforcement. **Must not deploy to production without backend authorization.** |

### Appendix E: Shared Components Registry

#### UI Components (`frontend/src/components/ui/`)

| Component | File | Consuming Portals | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ConnectWalletButton` | `ConnectWalletButton.tsx` | DApp, Workshop, Enterprise, Admin | Shared wallet connection button with `variant` prop for portal-specific accent colors |
| `CopilotChatPanel` | `CopilotChatPanel.tsx` | DApp, Workshop | Inline chat panel for LLM Copilot interactions |

---

### Appendix F: Context Provider Architecture

#### Provider Nesting Hierarchy

```
<ActiveVehicleProvider>          ← Vehicle registry + selection
  <BookingProvider>              ← Booking lifecycle + notifications
    <PartCatalogProvider>        ← OEM part catalog
      <EnterpriseProvider>       ← Aggregation (reads Booking + ActiveVehicle)
        <AdminProvider>          ← RBAC + config + audit + disputes
          <App />
        </AdminProvider>
      </EnterpriseProvider>
    </PartCatalogProvider>
  </BookingProvider>
</ActiveVehicleProvider>
```

#### Zustand Store Layer (Primary State)

Three Zustand stores form the actual state layer. The three Context providers — `AdminContext`, `BookingContext`, `EnterpriseContext` — are thin shims that expose these stores via hooks:

| Store | File | State Managed |
|---|---|---|
| `useAdminStore` | `store/useAdminStore.ts` | `WalletEntry[]`, `PlatformConfig`, `AuditLogEntry[]`, `DisputeEntry[]` |
| `useBookingStore` | `store/useBookingStore.ts` | `BookingRequest \| null`, `CompletedBooking[]`, `BookingNotification[]`, `WarrantyClaimRecord[]` |
| `useEnterpriseStore` | `store/useEnterpriseStore.ts` | `EnterpriseMetrics`, `FleetVehicle[]`, `WorkshopMetrics[]` |

> `ActiveVehicleContext` and `PartCatalogContext` are **standalone** (no Zustand backing) and retain direct localStorage access with `StorageEvent` cross-tab sync.

#### localStorage Key Registry

| Key | Context | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `noc_active_vehicle` | ActiveVehicleContext | `VehicleKey` (string) | Currently selected vehicle |
| `noc-booking-state` | BookingContext | `BookingRequest \| null` | Active booking/walk-in session |
| `noc-completed-bookings` | BookingContext | `CompletedBooking[]` | All completed service records |
| `noc-booking-notifications` | BookingContext | `BookingNotification[]` | All cross-portal notifications |
| `noc-admin-wallets` | AdminContext | `WalletEntry[]` | Wallet whitelist with roles |
| `noc-admin-config` | AdminContext | `PlatformConfig` | Platform configuration |
| `noc-admin-audit` | AdminContext | `AuditLogEntry[]` | Admin audit log |
| `noc-admin-disputes` | AdminContext | `DisputeEntry[]` | Dispute records |
| `noc-part-catalog` | PartCatalogContext | `CatalogPart[]` | OEM part catalog |
