## 1. Executive Summary

**NOC ID (Nusantara Otomotif Chain ID)** is a decentralized digital passport and vehicle performance tracking system built on the **Solana blockchain**. It creates an immutable, transparent, and verifiable lifecycle record for every vehicle — from the manufacturer's assembly line to the end consumer's garage.

The platform solves systemic fraud in the used-vehicle market (odometer tampering, hidden accident history, counterfeit parts) by anchoring every service event, diagnostic scan, and part replacement to an on-chain identity. A **Unified 3D Digital Twin** acts as the primary interface, letting any stakeholder visually inspect the real-time health of every component. An **Explainable AI (XAI) engine** forecasts part failures and provides actionable insights, while a **context-aware LLM Copilot** adapts recommendations based on the user role and the specific part being inspected.

The system is designed for **enterprise-grade scalability**, leveraging Solana's sub-second finality and Compressed NFTs (cNFTs) to keep per-vehicle minting costs below $0.01, making it viable for mass adoption by OEMs across Southeast Asia.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1. Industry Pain Points

| Pain Point | Impact | Current Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| **Odometer fraud** | ~40% of used cars in Southeast Asia have tampered mileage, costing consumers billions annually. | Paper-based service books that are trivially forged. |
| **Hidden accident & flood history** | Buyers discover structural damage post-purchase, facing costly repairs. | Reliance on manual inspections that miss internal damage. |
| **Counterfeit parts** | Fake brake pads, filters, and fluids compromise safety and void warranties. | Trust-based system with no cryptographic proof of part origin. |
| **Opaque maintenance records** | No single source of truth; records are fragmented across workshops. | Isolated dealership databases with no interoperability. |
| **Manufacturer warranty disputes** | Costly legal proceedings due to lack of verifiable maintenance proof. | Manual reconciliation of paper/digital records. |
| **Lack of predictive maintenance** | Reactive repair culture leads to higher total cost of ownership. | Generic OEM schedules that ignore real-world usage patterns. |

### 2.2. Why Blockchain?

A centralized database could store records, but it cannot guarantee **immutability** (records can be altered by the operator), **censorship resistance** (a single entity can deny access), or **trustless verification** (third parties must trust the database operator). Solana provides all three, with the throughput (65,000+ TPS) and cost structure ($0.00025/tx) necessary for high-frequency automotive data.

### 5.2. Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Solana over Ethereum/Polygon** | Sub-second finality, sub-cent transaction costs, native support for Compressed NFTs via Bubblegum. Critical for high-frequency maintenance logging. |
| **cNFTs over standard NFTs** | Genesis minting cost drops from ~$2 to ~$0.005 per vehicle. Essential for OEM mass adoption (millions of vehicles). |
| **PDAs for Maintenance Logs** | Program Derived Addresses provide deterministic, vehicle-specific on-chain storage without requiring new keypairs. Enables efficient lookups. |
| **Off-chain ML, on-chain anchoring** | ML inference is too compute-intensive for on-chain execution. Predictions are computed off-chain and their hashes are anchored on-chain for auditability. |
| **React Three Fiber (R3F)** | Production-grade 3D rendering in React. Enables component-level interaction, animation, and integration with the existing React component tree. |
| **RAG-based LLM over fine-tuned model** | RAG allows the Copilot to leverage real-time on-chain data without expensive retraining. Context injection per-click ensures relevance. |

    ]
  },
  "instruction": "Respond as the NOC ID Copilot. Adapt depth and terminology to the user_role."
}
```

#### 7.5.3. Role-Adaptive Response Examples

**For Owner (Rina):**
> "⚠️ Your CVT Belt is showing signs of wear. Based on your driving patterns, our AI estimates it may need replacement within 45 days. The biggest factor is the 6,521 km driven since your last CVT service. I'd recommend scheduling a CVT inspection soon. Would you like me to find a verified workshop near you, or show you OEM replacement parts?"

**For Mechanic (Pak Hendra):**
> "🔧 **CVT Belt — Critical (Health: 42/100)**\n\n**Diagnostic Summary:** Single CVT fluid replacement at 28,000 km. Current mileage: 34,521 km (6,521 km interval). XAI model flags `mileage_since_last_cvt_service` as primary risk driver (SHAP +0.38).\n\n**Recommended Procedure:**\n1. Inspect CVT belt for glazing, cracking, or width reduction.\n2. Check CVT fluid condition (color, smell, metal particles).\n3. If belt width < 21.0 mm, replace with OEM part #**K0800-4A00C**.\n4. Reference TSB #NTB-AT-22-006 for Avanza CVT calibration procedure.\n\n**Historical Note:** Only 1 CVT service recorded on-chain. OEM recommends every 20,000 km for this model."

## 11. Security & Compliance

### 11.1. Security Architecture

| Layer | Measure |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Solana wallet signature (primary), OAuth 2.0 + JWT (enterprise), WebAuthn (MFA). |
| **Authorization** | Role-based access control (RBAC). Roles: Owner, Mechanic, Manufacturer, Admin. |
| **Data in Transit** | TLS 1.3 (all APIs). WSS for WebSocket. |
| **Data at Rest** | AES-256 encryption for PII in PostgreSQL. |
| **NFC Security** | NTAG 424 SUN authentication (AES-128). Unique per-tap codes. Anti-cloning. |
| **QR Security** | HMAC-SHA256 signed JWTs with 5-minute TTL and single-use nonce. |
| **Smart Contract** | Formal audit by a reputable firm (e.g., OtterSec, Neodyme) before mainnet deployment. |
| **API Security** | Rate limiting, input validation, CORS policies, CSP headers. |
| **Dependency Management** | Automated vulnerability scanning (Snyk / Dependabot). |

### 11.2. Privacy & Compliance

| Regulation | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Indonesia PP 71/2019** (Personal Data Protection) | PII never stored on-chain. On-chain data is pseudonymous (wallet addresses only). |
| **GDPR (for future EU expansion)** | Right to erasure supported for off-chain data. On-chain data is non-PII by design. |
| **OJK Regulations** (if token is classified) | Legal opinion required. $NOC designed as utility token. No investment promises. |

### 11.3. Audit Trail

Every state-changing action is logged with:
- Timestamp (UTC)
- Actor (wallet address or user ID)
- Action type
- Before/after state hash
- Solana transaction signature (if on-chain)

## 12. Tokenomics ($NOC)

### 12.1. Distribution

| Allocation | % | Amount | Vesting |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ecosystem Rewards** (Proof of Maintenance) | 40% | 400,000,000 | Emitted over 5 years via smart contract |
| **Development & Team** | 20% | 200,000,000 | 12-month cliff, 36-month linear vesting |
| **Treasury / DAO** | 15% | 150,000,000 | Governance-controlled |
| **Strategic Partners / OEMs** | 10% | 100,000,000 | 6-month cliff, 24-month linear vesting |
| **Community & Airdrops** | 10% | 100,000,000 | Milestone-based releases |
| **Liquidity Provision** | 5% | 50,000,000 | Locked in protocol-owned liquidity |

### 12.2. Token Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Earn
        A["Mechanic logs service"] -->|"Proof of Maintenance"| B["$NOC Reward"]
        C["OEM mints vehicle"] -->|"Genesis Incentive"| B
    end
    subgraph Spend
        D["Owner"] -->|"Advanced AI Analytics"| E["Burn / Treasury"]

        F["$NOC Holders"] -->|"Vote on"| G["Protocol Parameters"]
        F -->|"Vote on"| H["Workshop Disputes"]
    end
    B --> D
```

### 12.3. Anti-Abuse Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description |
|---|---|
| **Reputation-Weighted Rewards** | New workshops earn lower $NOC per service until building reputation. |
| **Duplicate Detection** | On-chain deduplication prevents logging the same service twice. |
| **Anomaly Flagging** | ML model detects suspicious patterns (e.g., 50 oil changes in a day). |
| **Slashing** | Verified fraudulent entries result in $NOC stake slashing and credential revocation. |
